## Installation

Install locally into any project:

```bash
pnpm add -D ankh-test

## Getting Started

Create a test file like `Button.test.tsx`:

```tsx
import { describe, it, render, screen, assert } from 'ankh-test'
import type { PropsWithChildren } from 'react'

const Button = ({ children }: { children: PropsWithChildren }) => (
  <button>{children}</button>
)

describe('Button', () => {
  it('renders text', () => {
    render(<Button>Hello</Button>)
    assert.equal(screen.getByText('Hello').tagName, 'BUTTON')
  })
})
